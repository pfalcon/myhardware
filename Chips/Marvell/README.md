These docs were originally hosted at http://www.marvell.com, e.g.
http://www.marvell.com/embedded-processors/kirkwood/assets/FS_88F6180_9x_6281_OpenSource.pdf
but as of 2021 (likely, much earlier) no longer are (apparently,
vendor EOL). So, the content here is re-mirrored from
http://natisbad.org (thanks!).
